Since we are using Firefox, we have access to all [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), including the Notification API. With this API, we can create simple notifications that will be displayed on the user's screen. Check out the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) for more information on how to use this API.
