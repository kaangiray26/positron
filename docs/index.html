                <h2>What is Positron?</h2>
                <p>
                    Positron is a flatpak application bundled with Firefox and
                    Python to help you build standalone desktop applications on
                    Linux distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply design your application with HTML, CSS and use your
                    favorite Python and JavaScript libraries to add
                    interactivity.
                </p>
                <h2>But why?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because I think that the GUI development in Python is a bit
                    of a mess. There are many libraries and frameworks to choose
                    from, but all of them seem outdated or too tiresome to
                    design with.
                </p>
                <h2>What can I do with Positron?</h2>
                <p>
                    With Positron, you are using
                    <a href="https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/"
                        >Quart</a
                    >, which is a fast Python microframework, especially
                    designed for asynchronous programming including easy
                    background tasks and has Jinja2 templating engine built-in.
                    In a nutshell, you can get <b>crazy</b> with it.

                <p>It only takes few minutes to get started with Positron.</p>
