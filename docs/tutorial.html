                    <p>
                        This tutorial will guide you through building your first
                        desktop application with Positron.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Directory Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        After you run the Positron installation script, you'll
                        find (hopefully) some files and directories in your
                        project folder. I know this is boring, but we have to go
                        through all of them:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>icons/</code>
                            <p>
                                This is where you can put your icons in
                                different sizes to be used as the Flatpak
                                application icon.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>profile/</code>
                            <p>
                                This one is a Firefox profile, configured to
                                make your application look like a desktop
                                application. You can customize it using CSS as
                                you wish.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>static/</code>
                            <p>
                                Quart serves static files from this folder. You
                                can put everything here, even your Python
                                scripts if that makes sense for you.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>templates/</code>
                            <p>
                                This is where you can put your HTML templates.
                                Jinja2 is used to render them, so you can use
                                all its features.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>app.py</code>
                            <p>
                                This is the main Python script that the web
                                server runs. You can put your main logic and
                                routes here.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Dockerfile</code>
                            <p>
                                This is a Dockerfile that gathers necessary
                                dependencies with the correct Python version
                                that is supported by the
                                org.freedesktop.Platform runtime on Flatpak. It
                                builds a wheel package and creates an archive
                                that can be used in the build process.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>manifes.yml</code>
                            <p>
                                This is the manifest file that Flatpak-builder
                                uses to build the application. You can customize
                                it as you wish.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>org.flatpak.positron.desktop</code>
                            <p>
                                This is the desktop file that Flatpak uses to
                                create the application shortcut. You can
                                customize it as you wish.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>org.flatpak.positron.sh</code>
                            <p>
                                This is the script that Flatpak uses to run the
                                application. You can customize it as you wish.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>positron</code>
                            <p>
                                This comes from the installation script and is
                                just a simple helper script to automate the
                                building and running process.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>requirements.txt</code>
                            <p>
                                This is where you can put your Python
                                dependencies. The installation script will
                                install them for you.
