                            This tutorial will guide you through building your
                            first desktop application with Positron.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h2>
                        <p>
                            After you run the Positron installation script,
                            you'll find (hopefully) some files and directories
                            in your project folder. I know this is boring, but
                            we have to go through all of them for the record.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>icons/</b>
                                <p>
                                    This is where you can put your icons in
                                    different sizes to be used as the Flatpak
                                    application icon.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This one is a Firefox profile, configured to
                                    make your application look like a desktop
                                    application. You can customize it using CSS
                                    as you wish.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Quart serves static files from this folder.
                                    You can put everything here, even your
                                    Python scripts if that makes sense for you.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is where you can put your HTML
                                    templates. Jinja2 is used to render them, so
                                    you can use all its features.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is the main Python script that the web
                                    server runs. You can put your main logic and
                                    routes here.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This comes from the installation script and
                                    is just a simple helper script to automate
                                    the building and running process.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is a Dockerfile that gathers necessary
                                    dependencies with the correct Python version
                                    that is supported by the
                                    org.freedesktop.Platform runtime on Flatpak.
                                    It builds a wheel package and creates an
                                    archive that can be used in the build
                                    process.

                                <p>
                                    This is the manifest file that
                                    Flatpak-builder uses to build the
                                    application. You can customize it as you
                                    wish.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is the desktop file that Flatpak uses
                                    to create the application shortcut. You can
                                    customize it as you wish.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is the script that Flatpak uses to run
                                    the application. You can customize it as you
                                    wish.

                                    This is where you can put your Python
                                    dependencies. The installation script will
                                    install them for you.
