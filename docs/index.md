# What is Positron?

Positron is a [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) application bundled with Firefox and Python to help you build standalone desktop applications on Linux distributions.

Simply design your application with HTML, CSS and use your favorite Python and JavaScript libraries to add interactivity.

## But why?

Because I think that the GUI development in Python is a bit of a mess. There are many libraries and frameworks to choose from, but all of them seem outdated or too tiresome to design with.

## What can I do with Positron?

With Positron, you are using [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/), which is a fast web microframework, especially designed for asynchronous programming including easy background tasks and has Jinja2 templating engine built-in. In a nutshell, you can get crazy with it.

## How to get started?

It only takes seconds to get started with Positron.
